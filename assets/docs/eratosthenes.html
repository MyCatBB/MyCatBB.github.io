            <p>The Sieve of Eratosthenes (Air-Uh-Toss-The-Knees) is an ancient algorithm developed by the greek polymath, 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes of Cyrene
                    <span class="hoverbox">Hover box content for Link 1</span>
                </a> 
                (c. 276 BC – c. 195/194 BC).  The algorithm describes a very simple way to find all prime numbers up to a maximum value, $n$, and it does so without the use of multiplication or division.  This is notable since division, in particular, is

            </p>

            <p>The naive way to consider such a task is to simply check if each number, $x$,  up to $n$ is prime. Checking for primality is computationally difficult, although in 2002 (after <em>literally</em> <strong>thousands</strong> of years of thought) it <em>was</em> shown to be in the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity">complexity class P
                    <span class="hoverbox">Hover box content for Link 1</span>
                </a>
                ).  This difficult task needs to be done for every number $x$ less than $n$.  
            </p>

            <p>The simple approach to testing some number, $x$, for primality is to divide $x$ by every number less than the square root of $x$.</p>

            <p>We can stop at the square root of $x$ since $\sqrt{x}$ is the multiplicative &quot;half-way point&quot;.  That is, when I find a factor less than $\sqrt{x}$ I also find it&#39;s corresponding factor larger than $\sqrt{x}$.  For example, if I list out all the integers $a$, and $b$ such that $a \cdot b = 30$, I get the following:  </p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>a</td>
                    <td>b</td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>30</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>15</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>6</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>10</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>At this point I have started to find redundant factors, this is because we have passed over $\sqrt{30} \approx 5.47$.</p>

            <p>The process can be optimized a bit by only dividing by <em>prime</em> numbers less than $\sqrt{x}$.  The problem with this is the need for a list of primes up to $\sqrt{x}$, which makes the optimization ineffective for large $x$.</p>

            <h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2>

            <p>The Sieve does not require any primality testing and only involves the use of addition.  The steps of the algorithm can be outlined as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Generate the full list of numbers from $2$ to $n$.  
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>We can start at 2 since 1 is not prime, by definition.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </li>

                <li>Find the first unmarked value, $p$. This number is prime.</li>

                <li>Move through the list and scratch out every $p^{\text{th}}$ number, since it is a multiple of $p$ and therefore not prime.</li>

                <li>Repeat from step 2 until $ p \geq n$.
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>We found the end of the list.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>In other words, we begin by assuming every number is a candidate for being prime. Instead of finding the numbers that <em>are</em> prime, we eliminate numbers that <em>aren&#39;t</em>. Begin at the number $2$, it is prime. Every multiple of $2$ is therefore not prime; remove them from the pool. The next candidate is $3$.  Since it is not a multiple of anything before it, it must be prime. Now remove all multiples of $3$... and so on.</p>

            <p>I think it is important to recognize here that we are not exactly removing all multiples of the prime, $p$.  That is, of course, the effect; but it isn&#39;t really the action.  We never actually have to check if the number we scratch out is a multiple of $p$.  We simply move $p$ units to the right and scratch out whatever we land on. Even though checking for divisibility by $p$ is <em>one</em> division check, it is <strong>still</strong> a division check, and therefore slow. All we ever do is count to $p$ over and over again until we reach the end of the list.  This is what makes the algorithm so amazing; finding primes, which are <strong>defined</strong> by division, without having to divide.</p>

            <p>We can optimize step 3 by starting our search for multiples at $p^2$ instead of $2p$.  This is because every multiple of $p$ less than $p^2$ is a multiple of a prime less than $p$. Therefore, we have already scratched them all out when we found the smaller primes.  As an example, consider the first three primes, $2$, $3$, and $5$.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>$2$ is prime and so we scratch out all multiples of $2$ and we move on to the next prime, $3$.<br>Now we move three units to the right and land on $6$, but $6=2\times3$ so we scratched it out when we found all the multiples of $2$.  The first thing we have no information on is $3\times3 = 9 = 3^2$.  Start from here and scratch out all multiples of 3.<br>When we move on to $5$, we know that $2\times5 =10$ was scratched out during the $2$&#39;s and $3\times5=15$ was scratched out during the $3$&#39;s.  $4\times5$ was also scratched out during the $2$&#39;s since $4=2\times2$.  Therefore, we can start at $5^2=25.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>With the above optimization, we can rewrite the full implementation as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Generate the full list of numbers from $2$ to $n$.  
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>We can start at 2 since 1 is not prime, by definition.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </li>

                <li>Find the first unmarked value, $p$. This number is prime.</li>

                <li>Move through the list and scratch out every $p^{\text{th}}$ number beginning with $p^2$, since it is a multiple of $p$ and therefore not prime.</li>

                <li>Repeat from step 2 until $p^2 &gt; n$. All remaining unmarked values are prime. Complete.
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>At a certain point $p^2$ will be bigger than our maximum value, meaning we have nothing to scratch out anymore.  This will occur after $\sqrt{n}$ iterations.</p>
                    </blockquote>
